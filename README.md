## Bank-Application

A **_Banking Application_** I made, allowing the **_App User_** to create **_Customer profiles_** and **_Account profiles_** for given customers, only allowing 2 Accounts per Customer(**_Checking & Savings_**) where **_Withrdawals,Deposits, & Transfers_** are allowed. Data is saved in a **_MySQL Database_**, **_Driver.java_** allows an interface for the user to interact with the **_Database_**. I programmed a **_Graphical User Interface_** using **_Java Swing_** that allows the user to use the Application with ease
